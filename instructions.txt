# Main Goal
Your primary goal is to log into the web application and confirm that you have successfully reached the dashboard.

# Critical Instructions
- You must interact with the ACTUAL input fields and buttons, not their labels or containers
- When describing elements for localization, be extremely specific about the interactive element itself
- Verify after each action that the field was properly filled before proceeding

# Step-by-Step Instructions

## Step 1: Locate and Fill the Username Field
- The page is a login form with a username input field
- The username field is a text input box with placeholder "Benutzername *"
- IMPORTANT: You must click on the actual INPUT FIELD (the white/light colored rectangular box where text is entered), NOT the label text
- Once the field is focused, type "admin" into it
- Verify that "admin" appears in the username field before proceeding

## Step 2: Locate and Fill the Password Field
- Below the username field, there is a password input field
- The password field is a text input box with placeholder "Passwort"
- IMPORTANT: Click on the actual PASSWORD INPUT FIELD (the rectangular box), NOT the label or placeholder text
- Once the field is focused, type "password123" into it
- Verify that the password field shows masked characters (dots or asterisks) before proceeding

## Step 3: Click the Submit Button
- Below the password field, there is a submit button with the text "Anmelden"
- IMPORTANT: Click on the BUTTON itself (the rectangular clickable area with "Anmelden" text)
- The button should be clearly visible as a clickable element
- Click this button to submit the login form

## Step 4: Verify the Outcome
- After clicking "Anmelden", the page should automatically redirect
- Check the current URL or page title to confirm you are on "dashboard.html"
- Look for dashboard-specific elements (like "Dashboard" heading, logout button, tracking interface)
- Your task is complete once you confirm you are successfully logged in and on the dashboard page
